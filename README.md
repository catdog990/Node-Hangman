# Node-Hangman

Node-Hangman is exactly what it sounds like; it is a basic hangman game using node.  The user has to guess a word that is hidden; they are then prompted to choose any letter.  If the letter they chose matches any of the letters in the word, the letter is revealed.  If the letter they chose is not correct, the number of guesses left decreases.  If the user guesses all the letters, they are congratulated and prompted to play again.
